# JavaFX Gitpod javaFx Deployment:
Running a javafx application on an external environment can be a tedious and exhaustive task. Deploying JavaFX applications often involves managing numerous dependencies, and their inclusion can be a complex task. To simplify this process, I opted for Gitpod, providing a streamlined and straightforward deployment solution.
### To run this JavaFX program on Gitpod:  
* First open his repository on Gitpod by clicking the below button
    [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/danielcregg/javaFX-gitpod-helloworld-basic)
* When you have this repository open in Gitpod click on the ports button in the blue bar at the bottom of the Gitpod screen.
* Select "Open Browser" - This will open a new browser tab on which your javaFX GUI will be displayed when we run the program.
* Go back to the tab in which you have Gitpod running. You will see a terminal window at the bottom of the screen. One of the tabs will say Open Ports. Kill that tab. Now you should see a terminal prompt. Run the following command: 
`javac javafxapplication4.java && java javafxapplication4`
* Go back to the other tab you opened and you should be able to see a basic JavaFX GUI. Refresh the tab if it looks grey or has become disconnected.
